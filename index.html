          <p>
            Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] at the Reading
            Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania. Swift's father, Scott
            Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch and her
            mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), is a former homemaker who
            previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Her younger
            brother, Austin, is an actor. She was named after singer-songwriter
            James Taylor, and has Scottish and German heritage. Her maternal
            grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer. Swift spent her
            early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased
            from one of his clients. Swift identifies as a Christian. She
            attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori
            School, run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters, before transferring
            to The Wyndcroft School. The family moved to a rented house in the
            suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where Swift attended
            Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School. She spent her summers at
            the beach in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, and performed in a local
            coffee shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and
            performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also
            traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting
            lessons.Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired
            by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to just run around the
            block four times and daydream about everything." She spent weekends
            performing at local festivals and events. After watching a
            documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to
            Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music. She traveled with
            her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record labels and
            submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and The Chicks karaoke
            covers.She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that town
            wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I
            need to figure out a way to be different."
          </p>
          <p>
            When Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local
            musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. "Kiss Me" by
            Sixpence None the Richer was the first song Swift learned to play on
            the guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter,
            leading her to write "Lucky You". In 2003, Swift and her parents
            started working with New York-based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With
            his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their
            "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a
            Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record
            labels. After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase,
            Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and
            began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother. To help
            Swift enter into the country music scene, her father transferred to
            Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the
            family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee. Swift initially
            attended Hendersonville High Schoolbefore transferring to the Aaron
            Academy after two years, which better suited her touring schedule
            through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.

          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>
            Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American
            singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her
            vivid songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received
            critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading,
            Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country
            artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing
            in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005.
            Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country
            singer to write or co-write a U.S. platinum-certified album
            entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and
            released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the
            autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured
            into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and
            Evermore, whose singles "Cardigan" and "Willow" topped the Hot 100.
            Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over
            their masters, re-releasing two in 2021—Fearless (Taylor's Version)
            and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's "All Too Well (10 Minute
            Version)" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her tenth
            album Midnights (2022) and its lead single "Anti-Hero" broke
            numerous streaming records. Swift has self-directed music videos and
            films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and had
            supportive acting roles in others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the
            best-selling musicians of all time. She is the most streamed woman
            on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums open with over one
            million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 11 Grammy
            Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40
            American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; and 92 Guinness
            World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling
            Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest
            of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored
            with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade,
            Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.
            Her music is credited with influencing a generation of
            singer-songwriters.
