          <h2>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</h2>
          <p>
            Fearless (Taylor's Version) is the first re-recorded album by
            American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on April 9, 2021,
            through Republic Records. It is a re-recording of Swift's second
            studio album, Fearless (2008), and the first in the series of six
            re-recorded albums Swift has planned to release, following the
            dispute regarding ownership of the masters to her first six studio
            albums. Consisting of re-recorded versions of all of the 19 tracks
            from the Platinum Edition (2009) of Fearless, Swift's 2010
            soundtrack single "Today Was a Fairytale", and six bonus "from the
            Vault" songs that were withheld from being included on the original
            Fearless or its Platinum Edition, there are 26 tracks on Fearless
            (Taylor's Version), twelve of which were solely written by Swift.
            Recreating the album musically, the re-recorded tracks were produced
            by Swift and Christopher Rowe, using the same touring band that
            played the instruments on the original, whereas the newly added
            tracks were produced by Swift, Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner.
            Colbie Caillat returned to feature on "Breathe", while Maren Morris
            and Keith Urban contributed guest vocals on vault tracks "You All
            Over Me" and "That's When", respectively. The album was preceded by
            three of its songs, all of which entered the top 10 of the Billboard
            Hot Country Songs chart: "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" topped the
            chart, "You All Over Me" landed at number six, followed by "Mr.
            Perfectly Fine" reaching number two. Fearless (Taylor's Version)
            received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the precise
            replication of the original compositions, crisper production
            quality, nostalgic sentiment and Swift's strong, matured vocals.
            Commercially, it topped the charts in Argentina, Australia, Canada,
            Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, the United Kingdom, as well as the
            United States, where it marked the first ever re-recorded album to
            reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart, spending two weeks at
            the top, and became the second best-selling country record of 2021,
            behind its successor Red (Taylor's Version).
