          <h2>Folklore</h2>
          <p>
            Folklore (stylized in all lowercase) is the eighth studio album by
            American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album,
            released on July 24, 2020, via Republic Records. After the outbreak
            of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Swift cancelled the concert
            tour for her seventh studio album Lover (2019). During quarantine,
            she conceived Folklore as "a collection of songs and stories that
            flowed like a stream of consciousness", and worked with producers
            Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff virtually, recording her vocals at
            an inbuilt studio in her Los Angeles residence, while Dessner and
            Antonoff operated from Hudson Valley and New York City,
            respectively. Departing from the mainly upbeat pop production of its
            predecessors, Folklore consists of mellow ballads driven by
            neo-classical instruments, pursuing indie folk, alternative rock,
            and electroacoustic styles. Influenced by loneliness during
            quarantine, Swift explores themes of escapism, empathy, nostalgia
            and romanticism in the album, using a set of characters, fictional
            narratives, and story arcs, in contrast to the autobiographical tone
            of her previous projects. The title was inspired by the lasting
            legacy of folk songs, whereas its visual aesthetic reflects
            cottagecore. Upon release, Folklore broke the record for the biggest
            opening day on Spotify for an album by a female act.[note 1] Three
            of its tracks reached the top 10 of the record charts in eight
            countries, namely "Cardigan", "The 1" and "Exile", the first of
            which is the album's lead single and marked Swift's sixth number-one
            song on the US Billboard Hot 100. Folklore topped the charts in
            various countries and is certified platinum in Australia, Denmark,
            New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It
            was Swift's seventh number-one album on the US Billboard 200, where
            it reigned atop for eight weeks and became the best-selling album of
            2020. Folklore received widespread critical acclaim, centering on
            its emotional weight, poetic lyricism, and relaxed pace. Critics
            found its introspective essence timely for the pandemic and regarded
            its sound a bold reinvention of Swift's artistry. The album was
            featured on numerous 2020 year-end rankings, often referred to as
            the quintessential lockdown record. It won Album of the Year at the
            63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman in history
            to win the honor three times, following her wins for Fearless (2008)
            and 1989 (2014). She discussed Folklore and performed it live in the
            Disney+ concert documentary Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions,
            premiering on November 25, 2020, and released Folklore's sequel
            record, Evermore (2020), two weeks later. Several music artists cite
            Folklore as a source of inspiration.
