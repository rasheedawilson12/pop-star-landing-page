          <h2>Speak Now</h2>
          <p>
            Speak Now is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter
            Taylor Swift, released on October 25, 2010, through Big Machine
            Records. Swift wrote the album entirely herself within two years,
            while she was promoting her second studio album Fearless (2008).
            Inspired by Swift's transition from adolescence into adulthood,
            Speak Now is a loose concept album about her confessions regarding
            love and heartache, with some songs about her public experiences.
            Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the album combines country
            pop, pop rock, and power pop with rock sensibilities and melodies
            characterized by acoustic instruments, dynamic electric guitars,
            strings, and drums. After the album's release, Swift embarked on the
            Speak Now World Tour, which visited Asia, Europe, North America, and
            Oceania from February 2011 to March 2012. The album was supported by
            six singles, including the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles
            "Mine" and "Back to December", and the US Hot Country Songs number
            ones "Sparks Fly" and "Ours". Speak Now peaked atop charts and
            received multi-platinum certifications in Australia (double
            platinum) and Canada (triple platinum). In the US, it sold one
            million copies within its first release week, spent six weeks at
            number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified six times
            platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
            Speak Now received generally positive reviews from music critics for
            offering emotional engagement and radio-friendly songs. Some critics
            complimented Swift's grown-up perspective, but others took issue
            with the songs about vengeance and heartbreak as shallow. At the
            54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Speak Now was nominated for Best
            Country Album, and its third single "Mean" won Best Country Song and
            Best Country Solo Performance. The album appeared in 2010s
            decade-end lists by Billboard and Spin, and on Rolling Stone's 2012
            list of the "50 Best Female Albums of All Time". Critics have
            retrospectively named Speak Now one of the best country albums of
            the 2010s and described its songs about Swift's public image a
            precedent to her songwriting on subsequent albums.
