          <h2>Evermore</h2>
          <p>
            Evermore (stylized in all lowercase) is the ninth studio album by
            American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album
            released on December 11, 2020, via Republic Records, less than five
            months after Folklore, her eighth studio album. Evermore was a
            spontaneous product of Swift's extended collaboration with her
            Folklore collaborator Aaron Dessner, mainly recorded at his Long
            Pond Studio in the Hudson Valley. Swift described Evermore as an
            offshoot of "the folklorian woods"â€”an escapist, cottagecore-inspired
            direction she first ideated with Folklore during the COVID-19
            pandemic; she regards them as sister albums. Evermore blends
            alternative rock, indie folk and chamber pop styles, carried by
            fingerpicked guitars, somber pianos, lavish strings, and sparse
            percussion. Impressionist storytelling and mythopoeia dominate its
            lyrical technique. The subject matter has been described as an
            anthology of tales about love, marriage, infidelity, and grief,
            exploring the complexities of human emotion. American bands Bon
            Iver, Haim, and the National are featured. Earning widespread
            acclaim from critics, Evermore was praised for its character
            studies, experimental production, and Swift's nuanced vocals.
            Reviews regarded the album a sequel or a counterpart to Folklore,
            and various publications listed it in their 2020 year-end rankings.
            Evermore was nominated for Album of the Year at the 64th Annual
            Grammy Awards, a second consecutive nomination for Swift in the
            category after winning it with Folklore the previous year. Dessner
            and Long Pond have achieved mainstream notability since Evermore's
            release. The album reached number one in Argentina, Australia,
            Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Greece, New Zealand, Portugal, the United
            Kingdom, and the United States. Republic Records reported over a
            million copies of Evermore sold in its first week globally. It was
            Swift's eighth consecutive Billboard 200 number-one debut, spending
            four weeks atop the chart, and achieved various chart feats in
            Australia, the UK and the US; in the latter, the tracks "Willow",
            "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" impacted pop, country, and
            alternative radio stations, respectively. "Willow" became Swift's
            seventh Billboard Hot 100 number-one song and her second in 2020
            after "Cardigan", making her the first ever act to simultaneously
            debut atop both Billboard 200 and Hot 100 charts two times. Evermore
            was 2021's best-selling alternative music album and Americana album
            in the US and the UK, respectively.
