          <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
          <p>
            Taylor Swift is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter
            Taylor Swift. It was released by Big Machine Records on October 24,
            2006, in the United States and Canada, and March 18, 2008,
            internationally. Swift had signed with Sony/ATV Tree publishing
            house in 2004, at age 14, to pursue a career as a country musician.
            Her contract with Big Machine in 2005 enabled her to work on the
            album during her first high school year. Swift wrote or co-wrote 11
            of the album's tracks, including three by herself; Robert Ellis
            Orrall, Brian Maher, Angelo Petraglia, and Liz Rose have co-writing
            credits. Drawing on her personal life, the songs reflect Swift's
            outlook on life as a teenager, dealing with romantic relationships,
            friendships, and insecurity. Produced by Orrall and Nathan Chapman,
            Taylor Swift is a country record with pop and pop rock elements,
            incorporating acoustic instruments such as guitars, banjos, and
            fiddles. Five singles supported Taylor Swift, including the Hot
            Country Songs number-ones "Our Song" and "Should've Said No", and
            Swift's first top-15 entry on the Billboard Hot 100, "Teardrops on
            My Guitar". Swift promoted the album through social network Myspace,
            which journalists found atypical for a country musician's marketing
            strategy. She embarked on a six-month radio tour in 2006, and opened
            tours for other country artists throughout 2006 and 2007. Critics
            praised the album's mainstream sensibility and Swift's songwriting
            at a young age for earnestly depicting adolescent sentiments. Taylor
            Swift was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2008 Academy of
            Country Music Awards and helped Swift earn accolades including a
            Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. The album spent 24 weeks at
            number one on Top Country Albums and peaked at number five on the
            Billboard 200, becoming the longest-charting album of the 2000s
            decade. Certified seven times Platinum by the Recording Industry
            Association of America (RIAA), it made Swift the first solo female
            country artist to write or co-write every song on a platinum debut
            album. Journalists attributed Taylor Swift's success to Swift's
            online marketing via Myspace, which ushered in a younger demographic
            in country audiences who had mainly consisted of middle-aged
            listeners. The album's crossover appeal shaped the country pop style
            of Swift's next two albums, and its autobiographical narratives
            about love and heartbreak inspired a subsequent generation of
            singer-songwriters.
