          <h2>Reputation</h2>
          <p>
            Reputation (stylized in all lowercase) is the sixth studio album by
            American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was her last album
            released under Big Machine Records, on November 10, 2017. Swift
            conceived the album amidst rampant tabloid scrutiny on her personal
            life and celebrity during promotion of her fifth studio album, 1989
            (2014); she secluded herself from the press and social media, where
            she had maintained an active presence. Inspired by the fantasy
            series Game of Thrones, Swift split the album into two sides: one is
            vengeance and anger, and the other is love amidst the tumultuous
            events. She engaged producers Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, and
            Shellback, who created a record combining electropop, R&B, and trap,
            with influences from urban styles of EDM and hip hop. The overall
            sound features a heavy electronic production consisting of pulsing
            drum machines, swelling synthesizers, and manipulated vocals. Swift
            opted out of press interviews to promote the album, which she had
            done for previous releases. She cleared out her website and social
            media accounts, which generated internet attention and influenced
            other artists' album promotional campaigns. Reputation was preceded
            by the international chart-topping single "Look What You Made Me
            Do"; another single, "Delicate", reached number one on US Billboard
            airplay charts. Critics received Reputation with generally positive
            reviews; some took issue with both the sound and theme as harsh and
            bitter, but most praised Swift's songwriting for depicting intimacy
            and vulnerability. Retrospective reviews have described Reputation
            as an album of experimentation and emotional evolution for Swift.
            The album was Swift's fourth consecutive to debut atop the US
            Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies; it
            spent four weeks atop the chart. Reputation also topped charts in
            countries including Australia, Canada, and the UK. It was the
            best-selling album by a female artist of 2017, selling over 4.5
            million copies. Swift in support of the album embarked on the
            Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), which became the highest-grossing
            North American tour of all time. Reputation was nominated for Best
            Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, and was listed on
            Slant Magazine's list of the best albums of the 2010s decade.
