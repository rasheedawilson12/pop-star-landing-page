          <h2>Red (Taylor's Version)</h2>
          <p>
            Red (Taylor's Version) is the second re-recorded album by American
            singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on November 12,
            2021, through Republic Records, as the re-recording of Swift's
            fourth studio album, Red (2012), and the follow-up to her first
            re-recorded album Fearless (Taylor's Version) (2021). The release is
            part of Swift's response countering the purchase of the masters of
            her back catalog. The 30-track Red (Taylor's Version) includes the
            re-recorded versions of 20 songs from the deluxe edition of Red; the
            2012 charity single "Ronan"; the 10-minute-long, unabridged version
            of "All Too Well"; Swift's own recordings of "Better Man" (2016) and
            "Babe" (2018), both of which she wrote but had given to Little Big
            Town and Sugarland respectively; and six previously unreleased "From
            the Vault" tracks. All of the producers of Red, except Nathan
            Chapman, Dann Huff, and Max Martin returned to produce the
            re-recorded album alongside new inputs from Christopher Rowe, Aaron
            Dessner, Jack Antonoff, Espionage, and Elvira Anderfjärd. Phoebe
            Bridgers and Chris Stapleton joined the album as guest vocalists
            alongside original features from Gary Lightbody and Ed Sheeran. The
            album was met with widespread critical acclaim. Contemporaneous
            journalists described it as a classic pop record with a country
            core, infusing rock and electronic flairs. Its subject matter deals
            with various dynamics of love, life, loss and heartache. Swift's
            vocals, the enhanced production quality, and the new tracks were
            often commended in the reviews. Red (Taylor's Version) broke a
            string of commercial records, including the biggest vinyl sales week
            in MRC Data history and the Spotify record for the most single-day
            streams for an album by a female artist.[note 2] It topped the
            charts in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand,
            Norway, Scotland, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it
            was Swift's fourth number-one on the Billboard 200 chart in less
            than 16 months,[note 3] making her the fastest artist to collect
            four number-one albums. Swift promoted the album with televised
            appearances on NBC and a self-directed short film called All Too
            Well: The Short Film. Vault songs "I Bet You Think About Me" and
            "Message in a Bottle" were released as country and pop radio
            singles, respectively. Red (Taylor's Version) charted 28 of its
            tracks on the US Billboard Hot 100, garnering the record for the
            most single-week new entries by an artist; "All Too Well (10 Minute
            Version)" debuted atop the chart, becoming Swift's eighth number-one
            on the Hot 100 and the longest number-one song of all time—a feat
            recognized in the Guinness World Records. Winning various accolades,
            publications have highlighted Red (Taylor's Version) as a key pop
            culture moment of 2021.
