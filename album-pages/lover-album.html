          <h2>Lover</h2>
          <p>
            Lover is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter
            Taylor Swift. It was released on August 23, 2019, through Republic
            Records, and is her first album release after her departure from Big
            Machine Records, which resulted in a highly publicized dispute.
            Swift recorded Lover with producers Jack Antonoff, Joel Little,
            Louis Bell, and Frank Dukes from November 2018 to February 2019
            following her 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour, where she felt motivated
            by the fans, helping her recover her mental health after the
            controversies leading up to Reputation (2017). Swift conceived Lover
            as a "love letter to love", taking inspiration from her recalibrated
            personal life and newfound artistic freedom. Compared to the dark,
            heavy, hip hop-influenced tones of Reputation, Lover's brighter
            sound draws mostly from electropop, pop rock, and synth-pop, with
            melodies characterized by atmospheric synthesizers, mid-tempo
            rhythms, and acoustic instruments. The songs incorporate eclectic
            styles ranging from country and folk to funk and bubblegum pop; they
            explore emotions such as infatuation, commitment, lust, and
            heartache; a few discuss contemporary American political issues like
            LGBT rights and feminism. Swift, who had secluded herself from media
            attention after Reputation's release, embarked on an extensive
            promotional campaign for Lover through television shows, magazine
            covers, and press interviews. Lover's cover art and visual aesthetic
            feature bright pastel colors. Four singles were released—"Me!"
            featuring Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco, "You Need to Calm
            Down", "Lover", and "The Man"—the first three of which charted in
            the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100. Swift also played City of
            Lover, a one-day concert in Paris, on September 9, 2019. Lover was
            Swift's sixth-consecutive album to debut at number one on the US
            Billboard 200. It also topped the charts in Australia, Canada,
            Mexico, the UK, and elsewhere, and sold 3.2 million copies in 2019,
            becoming the year's best-selling studio album. Lover received
            positive reviews from music critics, who praised its emotional
            maturity and free-spirited sound, though some took issue with its
            disparate musical styles, calling it inconsistent. Many publications
            included the album in their lists ranking the best albums of 2019.
            At the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020, Lover was nominated for
            Best Pop Vocal Album; the title track was nominated for Song of the
            Year and "You Need to Calm Down" was nominated for Best Pop Solo
            Performance. The album won Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the American
            Music Awards of 2019, and its singles won four MTV Video Music
            Awards.
